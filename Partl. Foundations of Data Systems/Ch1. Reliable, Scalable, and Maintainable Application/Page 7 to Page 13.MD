### 1. Hardware Faults

#### Summary
Hardware faults like disk crashes, faulty RAM, and network disconnections are inevitable in large systems. Traditional solutions involve hardware redundancy, but modern systems prioritize software fault-tolerance, allowing systems to survive even entire machine failures. This approach enables seamless operations such as rolling upgrades without planned downtime.

#### Key Points
1. **Hardware Failures**:
   - Common issues: disk crashes, faulty RAM, power outages, and network errors.
   - Frequent in large datacenters due to scale.

2. **Redundancy Techniques**:
   - Use of RAID, dual power supplies, and backup power systems.
   - Redundant components minimize failure impact.

3. **Scalability Challenges**:
   - Increased machine use raises the frequency of hardware faults.
   - Cloud platforms like AWS prioritize flexibility over single-machine reliability.

4. **Software Fault-Tolerance**:
   - Enables systems to tolerate machine failures.
   - Supports operational improvements like rolling upgrades.

### 2. Software Errors

#### Summary
Systematic faults refer to problems caused by bugs or mistakes in the software rather than hardware issues. These problems are harder to predict as they don’t occur randomly but are instead related to the interaction between different parts of the system. This can result in widespread issues affecting multiple components simultaneously.

#### Examples
1. **A Software Bug**:
   - A bug in the software might cause failures across all instances. For example, in 2012, a Linux bug caused many applications to freeze when a "leap second" occurred.

2. **A Runaway Process**:
   - One part of the system consumes excessive resources (e.g., memory or bandwidth), leading to system slowdowns or crashes.

3. **Critical Service Downtime**:
   - If a system depends on another service (e.g., a database) and that service becomes slow, unresponsive, or returns incorrect data, it can create widespread issues.

4. **Cascading Failures**:
   - A small issue in one component can propagate, causing a chain reaction of failures across the system.


#### Best Practices for Mitigating Software Errors
1. **System Understanding**:
   - Carefully analyze system interactions and ensure assumptions are valid.

2. **Thorough Testing**:
   - Conduct extensive testing to uncover hidden bugs.

3. **Process Isolation**:
   - Design systems so that failures in one part don’t cascade to others.

4. **Crash and Restart**:
   - Allow processes to fail and restart cleanly, rather than attempting manual fixes.

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitor system performance to detect issues early.
   - Example: In a messaging system, monitor incoming and outgoing message counts to ensure consistency.

### 3. Human Error

#### Summary
Human mistakes, often surpassing hardware faults, are a leading cause of system failures. Designing systems to minimize human errors and their impact is crucial for reliability.

#### Strategies for Addressing Human Error
1. **Designing Systems to Reduce Mistakes**:
   - Create user-friendly systems that naturally guide users to do the right thing.
   - Make tasks intuitive and minimize opportunities for errors.
   - Avoid overly strict systems that might encourage users to find workarounds.

2. **Separating Risky Tasks**:
   - Use environments like “sandboxes” for testing and experimenting without affecting real users.
   - Isolate risky operations to prevent small mistakes from impacting the entire system.

3. **Testing at All Levels**:
   - Conduct thorough testing at every stage, from unit tests to end-to-end system tests.
   - Automate testing to quickly catch issues under rare conditions.

4. **Recovery from Human Errors**:
   - Design systems to allow easy reversal of mistakes (e.g., rolling back changes or recomputing data).
   - Use gradual rollouts for updates to limit the impact of errors.

5. **Monitoring the System**:
   - Continuously watch for performance issues, errors, or discrepancies.
   - Implement telemetry systems to identify and address problems early.

6. **Training and Management Practices**:
   - Ensure proper training so users understand the system and their responsibilities.
   - Encourage clear communication and accountability within teams.


#### Example Practices
- **Sandboxing**: Developers can test configurations or code changes in isolated environments without affecting production systems.
- **Automated Rollbacks**: Systems like version control allow quick restoration of previous states after an error.
- **Telemetry and Alerts**: Monitor message flow in a messaging system to detect inconsistencies and trigger alerts when issues arise.

## Reliability and Scalability in Software Systems

### Why Reliability is Important

Reliability is critical for all kinds of software, not just for high-stakes systems like nuclear plants or air traffic control. Everyday applications also need to be reliable because users and businesses depend on them. Here’s why:

1. **Business Applications**:
   - Bugs in business software can cause lost productivity and potentially legal issues.
   - For example, incorrect reporting of financial data might lead to regulatory penalties or lawsuits.

2. **E-commerce Sites**:
   - Online stores rely on uninterrupted uptime to generate revenue and maintain their reputation.
   - Even a short downtime can result in significant revenue losses and diminished customer trust.

3. **Non-Critical Applications**:
   - Even less critical software, like photo storage apps, carries users' trust. 
   - For example, if a parent’s app storing precious photos and videos of their children suffers from database corruption, it can lead to irreplaceable data loss and emotional distress.

4. **User Trust**:
   - Users expect software to perform consistently and correctly. Unreliable systems erode user confidence and loyalty.

5. **Legal and Regulatory Implications**:
   - Industries with compliance requirements may face fines or shutdowns due to software failures.

#### When Reliability Might Not Be Prioritized
There are cases where prioritizing reliability is less critical:
- **Prototypes**: During early development phases for an uncertain market, sacrificing reliability can save time and resources.
- **Low-Margin Services**: For services with thin profit margins, reduced reliability might be an acceptable trade-off to reduce costs.

### Scalability

Scalability is a system’s ability to handle growing demand without compromising performance. Modern systems must adapt to unpredictable growth.

1. **Challenges of Scalability**:
   - A system supporting 10,000 users might falter under the load of 100,000 users.
   - Increased data volume, complex operations, or higher traffic can strain system resources.

2. **Key Questions for Scalability**:
   - “How will the system respond to growth?”
   - “What changes or resources are needed to accommodate increased demand?”
   - “Can we add computing power or optimize processes without downtime?”

3. **Approaches to Scalability**:
   - **Vertical Scaling**: Adding more resources (e.g., CPU, RAM) to existing servers.
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more servers or instances to distribute the load.
   - **Load Balancing**: Using techniques to evenly distribute requests across resources.

4. **Scalability and Planning**:
   - Scalability is not a binary attribute. It involves thoughtful planning and system design.
   - Solutions like cloud-based infrastructure and distributed databases can help systems scale effectively.

5. **Real-World Example**:
   - A social media platform that starts small but rapidly gains popularity needs to handle the growth in user base, content uploads, and interactions without performance degradation.

## Understanding Load in Systems

Understanding the load and how to measure it is essential when considering scalability—how the system can handle increased demand in the future.


## Key Concepts of Load

Load is essentially the amount of work the system is performing. To describe and measure load, we use **load parameters**, which are specific numbers tailored to the system's architecture. Examples include:

- **Requests per second**: e.g., to a web server.
- **Read/write ratio**: e.g., in a database.
- **Number of active users**: e.g., in a chat room.
- **Cache hit rate**: e.g., frequency of fetching data from cache versus the database.

### Why Load Parameters Matter

Understanding the current demand on your system through load parameters is crucial before considering growth and scalability.

## Twitter as a Case Study

To explain load measurement and scaling challenges, let’s consider **Twitter**. Twitter’s operations generate significant load, mainly due to two functionalities:

### 1. Post Tweet
- **Operation**: Users post tweets, and these are recorded in the system.
- **Load**: On average, Twitter handles **4,600 requests per second**, peaking at **12,000 requests per second**.

### 2. Home Timeline
- **Operation**: Users view tweets from accounts they follow.
- **Load**: This operation generates about **300,000 requests per second**.

### The Scalability Challenge: The Fan-Out Problem
The "fan-out" problem arises because a single user may follow many others and also be followed by many. When a user posts a tweet, it needs to appear in the **home timelines of all their followers**, creating exponential load.

---

## Approaches to Handling Load

### Approach 1: Storing Tweets in a Global Collection

When a user views their home timeline, the system dynamically generates it by:
- Looking up all accounts the user follows.
- Retrieving tweets from these accounts.
- Merging tweets into a timeline.

This approach involves computationally expensive database queries, such as:

```sql
SELECT tweets.*, users.* 
FROM tweets 
JOIN users ON tweets.sender_id = users.id
JOIN follows ON follows.followee_id = users.id
WHERE follows.follower_id = current_user;
```

**Challenges:**
- Requires expensive database queries.
- Becomes inefficient as the number of users and tweets grows.

---

## Scaling Challenges in Twitter
While Approach 2 improved scalability, it introduced new challenges:

- **Fan-out writes:** Posting a tweet updates the home timeline cache for all followers. On average, a single tweet is delivered to about 75 followers. With **4,600 tweets per second**, this results in **345,000 writes per second** to the cache.
- **High-follower accounts:** Users with millions of followers create massive workloads. For instance, a user with 30 million followers would trigger 30 million writes for a single tweet.
- **Latency goals:** Twitter aims to deliver tweets to followers within **five seconds**, making efficiency critical.

### Key Load Parameter: Follower Distribution
The distribution of followers per user significantly impacts the load. Users with many followers generate a much higher fan-out load.

## Moving to a Hybrid Approach
To further improve scalability, Twitter adopted a hybrid approach:

1. **For most users:** Tweets are pushed to followers’ timelines (Approach 2).
2. **For high-follower users:** Tweets are fetched on-demand when followers view their home timeline (Approach 1).

### Benefits of the Hybrid Approach
- Balances the workload between regular and high-follower accounts.
- Ensures efficient performance for all user types.

## Key Takeaways
- **Understand Load Parameters:** Metrics like requests per second, read/write ratios, and follower distribution help assess system demand.
- **Optimize for Read vs Write Rates:** Systems with higher read rates benefit from caching and precomputing results.
- **Hybrid Solutions:** Combining approaches can address scalability challenges, especially for outlier cases.
